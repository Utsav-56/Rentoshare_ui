## 1. Introduction

**RentoShare** is a simple idea with a big impact. Many people own things like tractors, cameras, tools, or even have skills like photography, carpentry, or teaching. But they don't always use them. Instead of letting those things go to waste, why not rent them out or give them away to someone who really needs them?

RentoShare is an app and website where you can:

- **Rent your services or products** to others and earn extra money
- **Borrow or rent** services and items at an affordable price
- **Give away unused items** to someone in need, and feel good doing it

It is built for everyday users, not just techies. It focuses on helping people share, save money, and even help others through donations.

## 2. Problem Solved

- Many items like farming equipment, furniture, electronics sit unused.
- Skilled people don’t have a way to offer their services flexibly.
- People in need cannot afford to buy everything new.
- Most platforms don’t allow **donating** directly to those who actually need it.

**RentoShare connects the dots**: Lenders and givers with those who need.
